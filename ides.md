# IDEs

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is where you will do all your coding.

Finding one that you like and find easy to use can make your life a whole lot better. They vary in the functionality that they offer, with some being complete barebones, and others offering so much that there’s barely any space left on the screen to see your code.

You can get language specific ones, but as web tends to have you working in many languages simultaneously, I would recommend the following:

-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) – if you want it to work straight away
-   [Atom](https://atom.io) – if you have the time/ability to make it work, but you then get the benefit of Atom being highly customisable (this is what I use)
-   [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) – can get the professional version free if you make a student account
