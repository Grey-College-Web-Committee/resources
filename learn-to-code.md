# Learning to code

If you are wanting to learn new languages there are plenty of great free resources:

-   [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
-   [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/index.htm)
-   [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
-   [Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

If you are completely new to programming, I suggest starting with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
