# Glossary of terms

## IDE – Integrated Development Environment 
- A piece of software that you write code in
- IDE is to code what Microsoft Word is to documents

## HTML – Hyper Text Markup Language
- The basic language of web pages
- Uses tags
- Tags are words surrounded by <>

## CSS – Cascading Style Sheets
- A language used to make websites look pretty

## JavaScript
- A language that lets web pages do more than just display static text

## Underscore
- _
- That line above
- Sometimes called snake case
- My preferred way on naming files is to use an underscore between words

## Camel Case
- Another way of naming files
- noSpacesAreUsed
- The first word is all lower-case, then capitalise the first letter of any subsequent words

## Pascal Case
- Camel case, but also start with upper case
- Don’t use it!
- Some languages/technologies don’t like Pascal Case

## Kebab Case
- Underscore/Snake case but replace the underscores with hyphens ( – )
- Don’t use this either
- Most people use snake or camel case

## =
- Often times in programming, a single equal sign doesn’t mean the mathematical comparison of equalness (yes, its absolutely a word), it means that a variable on one side takes the value of the thing on the other side
- E.g. a = 4
- Means a variable called a now holds the value 4 

## == 
- Often a double equals sign is used to do the mathematical comparison
- E.g. if 1+4 == 2+3 then say “Matching”
- This line will make the computer say “Matching” if 1+4 is equal to 2+3

## !=
- Means “doesn’t equal”
- Is the opposite of == 

## print
- Often print is the word used in a program to make the computer “say” something
