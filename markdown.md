### What is markdown?

Markdown is a markup language (yes, another brilliant example of how CompScis like to name stuff).

A markup language is

> a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text.

from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language).

Markdown files have the file extension .md

### Ok ... so what _is_ markdown?

Basically, markdown is a language used to create nice looking text online.

Think of it like the big brother of the text file

A very common use case of the markdown language is to create README.md files.

### What is a README.md file?

For the most part, a README file is a file that describes what is in a folder/application/repository.

When a GitHub repo has a README, that README is what is displayed when you first view that repo on GitHub.

When the repo is for an application, the README would usually detail:

-   the features of the application
-   how to install and run the application
-   if it is open source, how to contribute to the application
